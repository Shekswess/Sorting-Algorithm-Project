# Sorting-Algorithm-Project

-This project is made for practicing and gaining experience with modules as matplotlib, numpy, time and repetition of different types of sorting algorithms

-The goal of this project is to make something simple but effective project. 

-This Project is designed as resume Project. With this Project I want to try some basic Python stuff, drawing and working with plots, working with sorting algorithms, working with numpy arrays, working with OOP stuff, etc.

-Maybe this Project is missing some stuff like working animation for the sorting process of the arrays and some optimisation with plotting the sorting array when working with Merge Sort.--

-Maybe this Project can be upgraded or better optimised but I'm satisfied.

-To run the project you need to have python3 installed. Also it will be easier if you have anaconda, if not then you need to install numpy and matplotlib. You download the code and you open the folder where the code is using the command line. You write:
# python main.py
You will be greeted with a "menu" what you can do with the system !

-I hope you like this project and find it helpful !
